In today's competitive job market, the effective prediction of salaries and 
accurate evaluation of resumes are critical tasks for organizations seeking 
to optimize their hiring processes. This paper explores the application of 
machine learning techniques in salary prediction and resume parsing, 
referred to as "resurate calculation". 
The study begins by examining the various machine learning algorithms 
employed for salary prediction, encompassing regression models, 
ensemble methods, and deep learning architectures. These algorithms 
leverage features such as job experience, skills, education, geographic 
location, and industry trends to forecast salaries with increasing accuracy 
Ultimately, the application of machine learning in salary prediction and resume 
parsing holds significant promise for revolutionizing the recruitment 
landscape, empowering organizations to make informed hiring decisions that align with 
both business objectives and candidate aspirations
